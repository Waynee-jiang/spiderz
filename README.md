# Spiderz
#### * Distributed crawling of Wikipedia using Apache Storm
#### * Store inverted index and link count(count-min sketch) in Redis

(shhh, I know this is trivial)

More details to come soon!

### TODO
1. Use first paragraph to index and search better
2. Make request for mutiple topics at a time
3. Improve hashing function used by count min sketch
4. Test in distributed mode
